            <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (<u>HTML</u>)</strong> is the 
            standard markup language for creating web pages and web 
            applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Web browsers receive <u>HTML</u> documents from a web server or 
            from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web 
            pages. <u>HTML</u> describes the structure of a web page 
            semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of 
            the document.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of <u>HTML</u> pages. 
            With <u>HTML</u> constructs, images and other objects such as 
            interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
            <u>HTML</u> provides a means to create structured documents by 
            denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, 
            paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <u>HTML</u> 
            elements are delineated by tags, written using angle 
            brackets. Tags such as <span class="code">&lt;img/&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;input /&gt;</span> directly introduce 
            content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide 
            information about document text and may include other tags as 
            sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them 
            to interpret the content of the page.
        </p>

            <h3>Markup</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            <u>HTML</u> markup consists of several key components, including those 
            called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, 
            character references and entity references. <u>HTML</u> tags most 
            commonly come in pairs like 'h1' and 'h1', although some 
            represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example 'img'. 
            The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is 
            the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
        </p>
        <p>
            Another important component is the <u>HTML</u> document type
            declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
        </p>
        <pre class="code">

            &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
            &lt;html>
                &lt;head>
                    &lt;title>This is a title&lt;/title>
                &lt;/head>
                &lt;body>
                    &lt;p>Hello world!&lt;/p>
                &lt;/body>
            &lt;/html>
        </pre>
